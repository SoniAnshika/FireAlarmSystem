# FireAlarmSystem
Fire Alarm System with the help of openCV. OpenCV is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing.
I had used Xml file to identify the fire among the other things. Xml file is made with the help of negative and positive images of the fire which will help us to detect the fire .
When the fire will be detected Alarm will be turned on to notify that fire is detected in the captured region.
